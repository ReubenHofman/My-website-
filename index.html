            <p> Funko Pops are so popular because of its low price-point, it's simply more accessible for fans of the franchise. So much so, it makes it easy for people to gift Funko Pops. If this doesn't prove how much price can affect popularity, we don't know what does! The collectors of the Kai variant may look down on the Funko Pop collectors. Funko history began in 1998 when Mike Becker founded the little company with a nostalgia-themed bobblehead line called Wacky Wobblers. The first item the company ever created was the Big Boy bobblehead. Over time, this once small company became a huge obsession with collectors and pop culture enthusiasts worldwide. The company’s most successful line, the Pop! Vinyl figure, officially debuted in 2010 (originally called Funko Force 2.0) and started a new addiction fans never knew they were craving. It seems there are new waves of Pop! Vinyl figures coming out every day, but while it’s the firm’s biggest, it’s not Funko’s only collectible line.
